# Gene classification based on cell type expression specificity and distribution

This module performs gene classification using scRNA-seq data. 

Steps:

1. Reduce sparsity by creating metacells or pooling
2. Normalize data and filter low count genes
3. Multi-thread gene classification for gene specificity and distribution
4. Compare orthologs classes between species
